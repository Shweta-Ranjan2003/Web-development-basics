<!-- An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to this, arguments, super or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill-suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors. -->

        //This variable is normally used to point the variable inside the function. But in the case of arrow functions, it points the variable outside the function. This is known as lexical this.
