An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of commands , functions , protocols , and objects that
programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.
API bridges the communication between different pieces of software

REST API - api that follows certain rules . here we use http protocol to interact with api (get,post,put,patch,delete).

API
*Endpoint - https://api.kanye.rest/

*Paths - https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming

*Parameters (goes in the end of url after ? and contains a key value pair) -
 https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?blacklistFlags=nsfw&type=single

*Authentication - Open weather (use your own api id instead of one provided by the default)
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=2491895b3419cf7d235144c467cc7f60&units=metric



Here as we can see its really difficult to add parameters in the url so to make it easy we can use an application called postman - in it we just have to write the url and down to it the parameters we want to add in form of key value pair.

Postman returns the request in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation)
eg - If we make a get request in postman to the endpoint https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544
we get
