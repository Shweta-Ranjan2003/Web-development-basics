REST - Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface
1. What makes an API RESTful?
- It uses standard HTTP methods - get,post,put,patch,delete
- A standard data format like JSON output
- Client-Server are completely separate not on same system
- Stateless - In a request fromm client it should contain all info 
              because server doesn not store client side data
- Resouce-Based
