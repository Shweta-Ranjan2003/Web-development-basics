// NPM is basically a package manager for Node.Js packages or modules. 
// to know version of NPM and Node, we can write npm --version and node --version respectively on the terminal. 
// as we write npm init on the terminal, it asks several questions like the package name, version, 
//description, entry point, keyword, author, etc. When we execute this, there is a new file called 
//package.json inside directory.if we write npm install slugify,package.json file will automatically get updated 
console.log("This is tutorial 69")
//major minor patch
// 1.0.0
// 1.0.1
// 1.1.0
// 2.0.0  
// There are times when we want to install the packages only for development purposes, not for production 
//purposes. In that case, dev dependencies are useful. The best example of this is nodemon. 
//It gives us the server which automatically gets restart every time. 

// To install this, we have to write-
// npm intall nodemon --save-dev
// npm install nodemon --global  for using it globally
